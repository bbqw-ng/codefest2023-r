Ever thought a meeting was useless and could've been sent through an email? 
Ever had that feeling where you knew an inevitable gathering was approaching, but you
knew that is was probably going to be a waste of time? Let us introduce to you our program alongside our predictive AI.
Our program will allow employers and managers decide whether or not to host a meeting 
based on previous input and ratings. We use a combination of different technologies 
and languages to create a functional program which could potentially help many software 
engineers and other programmers avoid needless meetings. A crucial structure that we 
used for our program was the decision tree. The decision tree is easy to visualize and 
also easy to provide metrics for such as purpose, affiliates, agenda, etc. The next essential 
part of our program would be our AI. We taught this AI with pre-generated mock data. We understand that
to implement this bot, we would have to host surveys after each meeting to collect opinions on whether or not 
an email should have been sent in place of it. Understanding that, we hope to further develop our product introduce 
it to mainstream technology enthusiasts.
